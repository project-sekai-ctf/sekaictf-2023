### Description

> As you all know, [DEF CON CTF Qualifier 2023](https://quals.2023.nautilus.institute/teams/4.html) was really competitive and we didn't make it. Surprisingly, 2 months before the finals in Las Vegas, we received an official invitation from *Nautilus Institute* to attend the event. Should we accept the invitation and schedule the trip?
