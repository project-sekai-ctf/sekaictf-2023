## Solution

All the operators below is done in `PolynomialRing(GF(2))`. Every time we choose a polynomial `f`, we essentially get 3 candidates on the value of `secret % f`. A naive solution would be querying 32 times and bruteforce all 3^32 possibilities using Chinese Remainder Theorem. This should be slow and impractical, but it can be optimized if we utilize the structure of all these possbile solutions. Let our query be $f_1, f_2, ... f_n$. The CRT tell us that the solution to

$$F \equiv c_i \pmod{f_i}$$

is 

$$F = \sum c_i A_i$$

where $f_1f_2\cdots f_{i-1}f_{i+1}\cdots f_n | A_i$, and $A_i \equiv 1 \pmod{f_i}$. Since we have 3 candidate $c_i$, let's say $c_{i, 1}, c_{i, 2},  c_{i, 3}$, the secret has the form

$$\sum c_{i, j_i}A_i$$

Therefore, it's in the space spaned by all $c_{i, j}A_i$. All $A_i$ has degree $16n$, and we have $3n$ basis. So as long as the degree of the secrets is less than $16n-3n = 13n$, we should be able to find the unique secret by Guassian Elimination. In the solution script I take $n = 64$, which is unnecessary large because 40 is enough.

## Suboptimal solutions

I'm aware of solution using meet in the middle, but that solution has the same spirit of mine, and given that this is not an algorithm competition, I'll let them pass.
