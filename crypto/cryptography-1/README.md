### Description

> Graphs have gained an increasing amount of attention in the world of Cryptography. They are used to model many real-world problems ranging from social media to traffic routing networks. Designing a secure Graph Encryption Scheme (GES) is important as querying plaintext graph database can leak sensitive information about the users.
