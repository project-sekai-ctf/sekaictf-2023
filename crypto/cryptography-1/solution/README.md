## Solution

Player is expected to understand the graph encryption scheme by reading the given library files. In particular, `DES` class is the underlying cryptographic primitive, where `GES` implements the graph encryption scheme.

With some research, player might be able to find this paper: [Efficient Graph Encryption Scheme for Shortest Path Queries](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3433210.3453099). Figure 1 has the algorithm in pseudocode. The library code is implemented in exactly the same way as the paper.

I have added enough comments to guide the player. In fact, `utils` and `DES` code are not needed to solve this challenge.

We are asked to send back the shortest path query given the ciphertext and the initially generated key. Upon reading GES `search` function, we just need to reverse the steps to get the plaintext. The steps are (as listed in paper):

1. Parse key as `(key_SKE, key_DES)`
2. Set variable `m = []`
3. Parse ciphertext into blocks of 32, because when searching and encrypting, we use 32-byte blocks as each piece of ciphertext.
4. For each block `ct_i`, decrypt it using `utils.SymmetricDecrypt(key_SKE, ct_i)` to get `pt_i` and append to `m`.
5. Deduct shortest path from source to destination from final `m`.

The main difficulty comes from understanding the source code - there's nothing in DES to be cracked, nor any cryptographic vulnerabilities to be exploited. Simply decrypt the ciphertext :)

The challenge is definitely easier if you find the original paper, which is in fact useful for solving challenge 2.
