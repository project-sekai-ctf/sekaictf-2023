## Solution

This challenge relies on Section 4.1 of the above paper, which discusses security concerns and the leakage profile. There are 2 main leakages:

1. Setup leakage. The setup leakage is the number of vertex pairs in `G` that are connected by a path.
2. Query leakage `(QP, PIP, t)`. `QP` is the query pattern, `PIP` is the path intersection pattern and `t` is the length of the shortest path between the source and destination.

> More intuitively, for any vertex `b`, all the incoming shortest paths to vertex `b` form a tree. In the worst-case (i.e., if the server has tokens for all paths to `b`), the server learns the structure of this tree.

In this challenge, we will act as an honest-but-curious attacker who does not have the key. Therefore we cannot simply decrypt the ciphertext like in challenge 1. The most we can do, as indicated in the paper, is to learn the structure of the tree given destination vertex if we have all the tokens.

How is that achieved? Remember that while the GES is response-hiding (i.e. the shortest path is not returned in plaintext to the client), the underlying DES is response-revealing. Since EDB is obtained by running DES on SPDX, the labels in EDB are derived from tokens obtained by running `DES.tokenGen` on input `(v_i, v_j)`. The tokens also appear in the values in EDB that are revealed to the server at query time, i.e. from `GES.search`.

This allows us to mount an attack to learn the tree structure. Basically, for a given destination `v`, we query from all possible sources `u` and record the tokens for each query. Because `PIP` is leaked (by comparing tokens), we can infer the tree structure.

For example, in a path `u -> w -> v`, if we query `(u, v)` and `(w, v)`, the second token after first search of `(u, v)` will be the same as the first token after first search of `(w, v)`. This allows us to infer that `u` is the parent of `w`. The whole process matches what is illustrated in Figure 2 of the paper.

Since we are allowed to make `NODE_COUNT` queries, we just query from all nodes to the given destination node `v` to recover the tree structure. It is then trivial to calculate degrees of each node. (In fact, `networkx` has such a function, so you only need to add edges to the graph.)
