### Description

> Here is the hardest part: Can you directly recover the shortest path query if you are the server, having access to the original graph and all queries? (On a side note, this setting is somewhat realistic in scenarios such as *Google Maps*, where the whole routing map is available to the adversary.)

> **❖ Note**  
> `lib.zip` remains unchanged in this series. The flag for this challenge will be used to access the next one when unlocked.
