# Notification - Solution

The challenge has 2 bugs: one uintended and one intened. The intended bug is use-after-free, it happens when we have 2 task with the same ID in the queue, which can happen because when we create child commands, there isn't a check if the ID already is in the queue. Duplicate IDs can result in UAF because when process_task finish the task after some time, it will have to remove the task from the queue by traversing db and check if ID is equal. This means when 2 task has the same ID, process_task will remove a different task but not the freed task in the queue resulting in a dangling pointer.  
  
The goal of the challenge is to abuse the UaF which means we have to create a type confusion in type segregation heap. This means we have to notice 4 things about libzone implementation:  
1. There are 2 types of zone: a normal size zone created with zmalloc and handled with zfree, and a newly-defined zone made with zone_create, handled with zone_alloc, zone_free.  
2. Zmalloc will create a new zone when the size has never been allocated before and will mmap a page for that zone. A new page will also be created with mmap when there is no free space left in any pages belong to that zone.  
3. A page will be unmmap when that page has all free space (which means every space in the page was first allocated and then all freed) and the number of page in a zone >= 3.  
4. Libzone will use free space in page with least free chunk.  

P/s: Free space in libzone means that space was first allocated and then freed.  
  
With this in mind, we have to unmmap the page with the UaF task, and then mmap a different page in a different zone to replace that space and create a type confusion between 2 different objects. This is very easy due to how unmmap and mmap in linux works. Mmap will keep growing down from a base, and unmmap will remove that page and if it's the last page the next mmap will replace it.   
    
The unintended bug is the leak bug when we create child commands. There isn't a length check due to I copy-pasted the code from creating parent command resulting in a very buggy check. :']   
Even though the leak is unintended, I'm glad there is one because without leak and abusing only UAF to create a leak primitive is a painful process. You can check my solve script to see there was a lot of complexity involved in heap shaping.  
The general idea was:
1. Type confusion between task (UaF) and out_message. So when we cancel task, it will freed the buffer in inline_mes of out_message. This create another UaF
2. Use the UaF earlier to create type confusion between normal buffer zone and a task zone. So when we check_message, the normal buffer (UaF) will print out the value in task zone.   
  
After getting the leak, we can just type confusion between task and normal buffer zone to get arbitrary call with cancel_callback function pointer.   
P/s: Dont read my solution script, I dont really know how to cleanup and makes thing more understandable. It's just a lot of heap feng shui stuffs to create leak primitive. You can absolutely do it with the knowledge about libzone implementation. And the best way to understand heap feng shui is to do it yourself with general ideas.
