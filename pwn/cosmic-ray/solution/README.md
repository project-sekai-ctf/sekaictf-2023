# Cosmic Ray - Solution

There is an obviously vulnerable gets call, however a canary prevents any buffer overflows. Additionally, a single bit flip isn't enough to cause any canary leak. However, the program is compiled without PIE so a bit can be flipped in the program's instructions, specifically those that check if the canary has been overwritten.

```
0x00000000004016e7 <+158>:   mov    rdx,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
0x00000000004016eb <+162>:   sub    rdx,QWORD PTR fs:0x28
0x00000000004016f4 <+171>:   je     0x4016fb <main+178>
0x00000000004016f6 <+173>:   call   0x401130 <__stack_chk_fail@plt>
```

Immediately after the gets call, the stack canary is checked and a je (jump-if-equal) instruction is called which will cause the program to continue normally if the canary isn't overwritten or call stack_chk_fail if it is. However, we can flip the lowest bit at address 0x4016f4, changing the byte from 0x74 to 0x75. Referencing an opcode table such as the one here: http://ref.x86asm.net/coder32.html will tell you this changes the instruction from a je to jne. This allows us to overwrite the canary, as the program will now continue with standard execution if the canary is overwritten and call stack_chk_fail if it is untouched. Then just simple ret2win for the flag.
