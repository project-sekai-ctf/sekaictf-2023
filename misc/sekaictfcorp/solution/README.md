## SekaiCTFCorp Writeup

Main steps:
- Find github repository and notice typo in docker base image name
- Pull image and compare layers to discover exec(...) statement in `/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/werkzeug/routing/map.py` that allows us to spawn a reverse shell
- Find Gogs service running on other docker container on :3000
- Find password for admin user in environment
- Login to Gogs and use git hooks to get a shell on the gogs container
- Find host home directory is mounted on container
- Put SSH key in .ssh folder and ssh into host machine as david (we can derive the username from the bash history)
- Find suid binary that calls ruby script
- Use  `RUBYLIB` environment variable and point it to a variable with a ruby script that gets automatically loaded (https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/master/builtin.c#L69, https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/master/gem_prelude.rb)
