### Description

> Hello, worker!
>
> It’s really great to see you again after our 42 years of hard work. I almost thought you would never come back when you left for the other 7 billion.
>
> The employee, as usual, has sent you the instructions, and said something like...
>
> > **“You should get a big check mark if everything goes well.”**
>
> I don’t really know what that means, but it must be something promising.
>
> The Facilities Management has left you some notes on the floor. Consult them when in doubt. They must be very useful. I believe you can do a good job, just like the last 42 years. Good luck!
>
> *Your presence is requested on the next floor*,  
> Management
